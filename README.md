# Auebflix
C++ Project @ AUEB <br/> <br/>

A simple Film Browser that runs on a custom windowing system using the SGG (Simple Game Graphics) library. <br/><br/>

The assets required to run the executable can be downloaded here: <br/>
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dYeeYtOf8ZihzwcY_XaBDtYxjis2-yYy?usp=sharing <br/><br/>

The downloaded assets must be placed in a folder called 'assets' located in the same directory as the executable.
